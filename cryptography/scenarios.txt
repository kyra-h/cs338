1. Alice wants to send Bob a long message, and she doesn't want Eve to be able to read it. Assume for this scenario that AITM is impossible.
- For this scenario, I would have Alice and Bob use the Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree upon a shared K. Alice can then use K to encrypt the message and send it to Bob. 
- To do the Diffie-Hellman exchange, Alice will choose 2 numbers, g & p. Alice will also choose a number, a. Alice will send to bob g, p. and (g^a) mod p (A). Bob will send Alice (g^b) mod p (B). They can now both compute p, by doing B^a mod p and A^b mod p. With this key, they can do symmetric encryption.
- To do the symmetric encryption, they will do AES. Alice will send C = AES(K, M), and Bob will decode this by doing AES_D(K, C) to get M. 

2. Alice wants to send Bob a long message. She doesn't want Mal to be able to modify the message without Bob detecting the change.
- For this scenario, Alice could send a message encoded with her secret key(S_A). Anyone would be able to read the message, but they wouldn't be able to change it, as they would need Alice's secret key(S_A) to re-encode the altered message. Bob can decode this message with Alice's Public Key (P_A). If the message is modified, when Bob decodes the message there will likely be some gibberish somewhere in the decoded text.. 

3. Alice wants to send Bob a long message (in this case, it's a signed contract between AliceCom and BobCom), she doesn't want Eve to be able to read it, and she wants Bob to have confidence that it was Alice who sent the message. Assume for this scenario that AITM is impossible.
- Alice and Bob could use the Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree upon a shared K, which they will use to send the long message. 
- Bob can send Alice a random number, R. 
- Then, Alice can send a message C = E(S_A, R) encoded with Alice's secret key (S_A) saying it's me, Alice. Bob can decrypt this message by doing E(P_A, C). If Bob gets R from this decryption, he will know that he is talking to Alice. 

4. Consider scenario #3 above. Suppose Bob sues Alice for breach of contract and presents as evidence: the digitally signed contract (C || Sig) and Alice's public key P_A. Suppose Alice says in court "C is not the contract I sent to Bob". (This is known as repudiation in cryptographic vocabulary.) Alice will now need to explain to the court what she believes happened that enabled Bob to end up with an erroneous contract. List at least three things Alice could claim happened. For each of Alice's claims, state briefly how plausible you would find the claim if you were the judge. (Assume that you, the judge, studied cryptography in college.)
- Someone has Alice's secret key (plausible)
- There was an adversary in the middle, which modified the contract when it was being sent to Bob. In this scenario, Bob sent Alice a contract. Alice signed the contract. Alice tried to send the contract to Bob, but instead sent it to the AITM. The AITM modified the contract, then sent it to Bob. (also plausible) 
- There was an adversary in the middle, which modified the contract when it was being sent to Alice. Then, they sent the original contract || Sig to Bob. (also plausible) 

5. For this scenario, suppose the assumption that everybody has everybody else's correct public keys is no longer true. Instead, suppose we now have a certificate authority CA, and that everybody has the correct P_CA (i.e. the certificate authority's key). Suppose further that Bob sent his public key P_B to CA, and that CA then delivered to Bob this certificate:
Cert_B = "bob.com" || P_B || Sig_CA
In terms of P_CA, S_CA, H, E, etc., of what would Sig_CA consist? That is, show the formula CA would use to compute Sig_CA.
- Sign_CA will consist of E(S_CA, H("bob.com" || P_B)). A user can validate this, by ensuring H("bob.com" || P_B) == E(P_CA, Sign_CA)

6. Bob now has the certificate Cert_B from the previous question. During a communication, Bob sends Alice Cert_B. Is that enough for Alice to believe she's talking to Bob? (Hint: no.) What could Alice and Bob do to convince Alice that Bob has the S_B that goes with the P_B in Cert_B?

7. Finally, list at least two ways this certificate-based trust system could be subverted, allowing Mal to convince Alice that Mal is Bob.
