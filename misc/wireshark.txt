1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames.
- 
2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?
3. Why does the client need a port?
4. What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)
5. What is the full content (not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers) of the frame? What do each of the pieces of the frame content represent? (Most of the frame content is things like the year, month, day, hour, etc., but there's a little more info, too.)
6. What does [SYN] mean?
7. What does [ACK] mean?
8. What does [FIN] mean?
9. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
