+ Plan for using Kali:
- Kali is installed on my computer. I will access it through the virtual machine on UTM.

+ Kali Installation Status:
- Kali is installed successfully (I hope :))

+ Observations/Concerns:
- The mouse thing is a little difficult for me. I've been using the arrow keys successfully but I couldn't get the ctrl+cmd to work to get the mouse back. 
- I allocated 40GB of storage, but am worried I will need more for comps. I do not have this much storage available on my computer.
